# Skin pathogen antagonists
Finding skin pathogen antagonists in the AgBiome collection.

**Goal**: Demonstrate to potential partners AgBiome's capability to rapidly identify promising leads for common skin bacterial pathogens.\

**Target pathogens**:
- *Cutibacterium acnes* - Gram-positive, slow-growing, aerotolerant anaerobe. Linked to acne and causative agent of chronic blepharitis and endophthalmitis (eyelid and eye infections). 
- *Staphylococcus aureus* - Gram-positive, aerobic. Commensal skin and upper respiratory microorganism - can be an opportunistic pathogen. Skin infections, respiratory infections, sinus infections.   

**Conditions**: All isolates were already run through [AntiSMASH](https://github.com/antismash/antismash) (v. 5.0.1) and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were grouped into gene cluster families (GCF) using [BiG-SLiCE](https://github.com/medema-group/bigslice) (v. 1.1.1).
